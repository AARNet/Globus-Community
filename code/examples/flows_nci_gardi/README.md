This resource comes from community member **Dr Kisaru Liyanage** who presented at the AARNet/Globus Tech-catchup on Friday 12 September 2025.
 
Kisaru presented his work integrating Globus Flows with NCI’s Gadi supercomputer.

* A recording of the session can be found on the [AARNet YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/kXD901EpRkM?si=FxLv39K696VxxcO-).
* Code from the presentation can accessed on [Kisaru's GitHub account](https://github.com/kisarur/gadi-genomics-globus-flow).
* A copy of the [presentation slides is avaliable here](Gadi%20Globus%20Flow%20Slides.pdf).

There's growing interest in using Globus Flows and Compute to automate pipelines between instruments and HPC facilities (tier-1 and tier-2). Any community members who'd like to try a Globus Flow that interacts with Gadi, please feel free to contact Kisaru.
