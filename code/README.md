The examples folder contains code examples for various useful tasks using Globus.

All example code is provided on an as-is basis and are provided strictly on a "use at your own risk" basis. The examples are intended not as complete solutions, but rather as an indicator of how to approach particular tasks.

### Globus Flows on NCI Gardi

Community member Dr Kisaru Liyanage demonstrates his work integrating [Globus Flows with NCI’s Gadi supercomputer](./examples/flows_nci_gardi/). 

### Bandwidth Throttling

This is an example of [how to throttle bandwidth outbound from a Globus server under Ubuntu 22.04](./examples/bandwidth_throttling/).

### Folder Watcher

This is an example of [how to set up a folder watcher script to automate Globus transfers when new files appear](./examples/folder_watcher/). This is potentially useful where the Globus synch option is not appropriate, for example, when transferred files need to be removed from the destination collection as part of a workflow and without needing to re-transfer them.

### Globus Ansible

This is an example of [how to use Ansible to automate the setup of a Globus endpoint, DTN, storage gateway, and mapped collection](https://github.com/AARNet/Globus-Community/tree/main/code/examples/globus_ansible).

### Advanced Globus Workshop Jupyter Notebooks
