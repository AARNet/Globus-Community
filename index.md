# Globus Community (Australia) Information Resources (managed by [AARNet](https://www.aarnet.edu.au/globus))

Globus Community AU is a central hub for staff at Australian universities and research institutions who are using the Globus data movement service.

Hosted by AARNet, this community fosters collaboration among IT administrators, researchers, and Globus group managers by providing a platform to share knowledge, resources, and best practices. Members have access to a GitHub repository for asynchronous communication and resource exchange, as well as regular meetings, webinars, and training sessions for real-time engagement. These events, such as Office Hours and Team Globus catch-ups, offer opportunities for learning and problem-solving.

The community aims to enhance the user experience with Globus by promoting open communication and support and is committed to advancing the effective use of Globus and driving innovation in data movement practices. This directory contains useful Globus information resources for training and testing.
