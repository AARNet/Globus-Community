## AARNet eResearch Australasia 2025 Workshop - Advanced Globus

## Overview

In this half-day workshop, we will be exploring some advanced Globus configurations. At the conclusion of the workshop, you should be able to:

- Use connectors to interface Globus with storage systems other than Posix (e.g. S3) 
- Implement automated workflows using Globus Flows to streamline your data processing and management tasks 
- Use tools like Jupyter Notebooks with Globus 
- Use Globus Compute to schedule jobs in HPC environments 
- Set up custom user mappings for Globus authentication on local resources and optimise security settings 

If time permits, we may be able to have an open discussion on real use-cases.

Note that there is a shared document for the workshop [here](http://tiny.cc/eRA24Globus). You will be able to add questions on notice if we don't have time to answer them interactively during the workshop.

## Workshop Prerequisites

You will need to bring the following to the workshop:

- A laptop with the ability to connect to an AWS EC2 instance via SSH in order to complete the hands-on sections of the workshop. Please ensure that your firewall permits outbound SSH access to arbitrary IP addresses. Power and WiFi will be provided.
- A valid educational or research institution account to gain access to Globus (must be available in [EduGain](https://edugain.org/) via the [Australian Access Federation (AAF)](https://aaf.edu.au/)) or [Tuakiri](https://www.reannz.co.nz/products-and-services/tuakiri/). A list of AAF institutions is available [here](https://aaf.edu.au/subscribers/), and Tuakiri [here](https://www.reannz.co.nz/membership/members/). Alternatively, you can also use ORCID, GitHub or Google to access Globus for the workshop.
- Sufficient familiarity with the Linux command line so that you are able to perform basic command line operations, edit text files, and install packages. If you are completely unfamiliar with Linux, you will still benefit from attending the workshop, but you may need assistance with the hands-on sections. Please let us know beforehand if you are likely to require this assistance.

Optionally, the following would be useful:

- The ability to install Globus Connect Personal (GCP) software on your laptop. You may wish to download this software from https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-personal and pre-install it before the workshop, or it can be downloaded and installed in the workshop. Note that if you are unable to install GCP due to restrictions on your laptop, you will only be able to observe demonstrations of its use.

To get the most out of this workshop, you should already be able to:

- Know what Globus is and the benefits it provides for researchers
- Use the Globus web interface to transfer files between collections
- Understand the high-level architecture of Globus
- Install Globus Connect Personal software and set up a local endpoint with collections
- Install Globus Connect software on a Linux host and set up an endpoint with collections
- Configure Globus Storage Gateways and Collections for fine-grained access control
- Know how to monitor user activity on your collections

These skills were covered in the half-day ["Introduction to Globus" workshop](../introduction_to_globus_workshop/) run by AARNet at eResearch Australasia in 2024 and 2025.

Please contact alex.ip@aarnet.edu.au, steele.cooke@aarnet.edu.au or chris.myers@aarnet.edu.au if you are unsure about any of the above requirements.
