# AARNet Public Globus Test Collections

The following collections have been made available by AARNet to help Australian users test their Globus endpoints against high-performance endpoints on AARNet infrastructure.
The collections are published from servers with 100GB/s network interfaces and fast RAID0 NVME storage for parallel writes. These servers are connected directly to the AARNet network.
