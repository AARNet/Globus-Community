# Getting Started with Globus

## Set up your own Globus endpoint

There are many useful resources at [Getting Started Globus Videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLjLsO6hgVw&list=PLLCSx-IFoBeu2F-HF-DMoc5_AUsvYft8c)

In particular, [Introduction to Globus for System Administrators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86uEdOOfY7g&t=2272s) gives a complete overview of how to set up a Globus endpoint.

For Australian users in the academic and research sector, AARNet can help you with this setup.

Once you have set up a working endpoint, you should arrange a free trial subscription in order to test out the enterprise-level features offered.
