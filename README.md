The Globus platform provides a secure data transfer and management service that facilitates end-to-end automation of complex research flows.  

Hosted by AARNet, **Globus Community Australasia** is a central hub for staff at Australian and New Zealand universities and research institutions who are using the Globus data movement service. The community aims to foster collaboration among IT administrators, researchers, and Globus group managers by providing a platform to share knowledge, resources, and best practices.

The community aims to help advance the effective use of Globus and drive innovation in data movement practices across the Australian and New Zealand research sectors. Members have access to a GitHub repository for asynchronous communication and resource exchange, as well as regular meetings, webinars, and training sessions for real-time engagement. These events, such as Office Hours and Team Globus Catch-ups, offer opportunities for learning and problem-solving.

If you have any questions, please contact us at globus@aarnet.edu.au.


## Community events

### AARNet and Globus Technical Catch Ups

These sessions aim to provide more information about Globus and to help with problems or issues relating to your Globus service or general data movement. AARNet and Globus product specialists are available during these sessions to share knowledge and provide assistance, as well as to introduce any new features or functionality. 

Find out more and [register your interest](https://aarnet.edu.au/aarnet-globus-technical-catch-ups).

### The Data Movers Lab
These monthly clinics aim to help with research challenges using Globus and FileSender data movement tools. Participants can drop in any time, and bring along any problems they are trying to solve or issues they need to address that are related to Globus or FileSender. Staff from the AARNet Digital Research Team will be available to share knowledge and assist users to make the most of these data movement services.

## Case Studies 

### Enabling astronomy at scale with AARNet and Globus 
Astronomers studying long-period radio transients with South Africa’s MeerKAT telescope generate up to 2 TB per session. Using Globus over AARNet’s high-speed network, they transfer data to Australia quickly and reliably, enabling rapid analysis, refining observations, and sustaining scientific momentum across vast international distances.

### AARNet and Globus support critical data transfer 
The Australian Apollo Service migrated 15 TB of research data during an infrastructure change at the Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre. Using Globus over AARNet’s high-speed network, they achieved a fast, secure, and disruption-free transfer, preserving metadata and ensuring life science researchers maintained seamless access to critical data and workflows throughout the transition.

### The Role of Globus in International Genome Research  
Genetics technical specialists at the Biomolecular Resource Facility (BRF) are using Globus to transfer and share huge datasets through AARNet with national and international collaborators. Globus has greatly sped up their data delivery process, eliminating the need to spend time and resources to compress data into smaller files before sending them. For a recent project, they were able to transfer over 3 TB from their laboratory in Australia to a collaborator in New Zealand in only three hours using Globus.
